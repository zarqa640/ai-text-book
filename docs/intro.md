# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** - your comprehensive guide to humanoid robotics and physical AI systems using ROS 2.

## About this Book

This book focuses on humanoid robotics and physical AI applications using ROS 2, including Python 3.10+ (for ROS 2 Humble/Iron compatibility), rclpy, Gazebo, RViz, and URDF integration. This comprehensive guide provides all the information you need to understand, develop, and deploy humanoid robotics systems.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill or Iron Irwini](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html)
- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 20.0 or above for documentation development

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/specikit-test.git
   cd specikit-test
   ```

2. Install ROS 2 dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Follow the ROS 2 installation guide for your OS
   # Install rclpy, Gazebo, RViz, and other required packages
   ```

3. For documentation development, navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend/website
   npm install
   npm run start
   ```

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.
