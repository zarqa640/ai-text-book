# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module covers the digital twin approach using Gazebo physics simulation and Unity high-fidelity visualization for humanoid robots.

## Overview

The Digital Twin module focuses on creating virtual representations of physical robots and environments. This allows for safe testing and development before deploying on physical hardware.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you will learn about:

- **Gazebo Physics Simulation**: Creating realistic physics simulations with gravity, collisions, and environmental interactions
- **Unity Integration**: High-fidelity visualization and advanced rendering for humanoid robots
- **Sensor Simulation**: Simulating LiDAR, cameras, IMU, and other sensors for perception testing

## Chapters

- [Chapter 1: Gazebo Basics](./chapter-1-gazebo-basics.md)
- [Chapter 2: Unity Integration](./chapter-2-unity-integration.md)
- [Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation](./chapter-3-sensor-simulation.md)

The digital twin approach is essential for humanoid robotics development as it allows you to test complex behaviors in a safe, virtual environment before deploying on expensive physical hardware.
