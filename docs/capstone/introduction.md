# Capstone Project: Autonomous Humanoid Robot

## Bringing It All Together

The capstone project integrates all four modules to create an autonomous humanoid robot that can understand natural language commands and execute them in the real world.

## Project Requirements

Your robot should be able to:
- Understand natural voice commands ("Clean the room")
- Plan a path to navigate the environment
- Detect and avoid obstacles
- Identify objects using computer vision
- Manipulate objects (pick and place)

## Integration Steps

1. Combine the ROS 2 communication system
2. Integrate the digital twin simulation
3. Connect the AI robot brain
4. Add Vision-Language-Action capabilities

## Exercise: Plan Your Capstone Implementation
