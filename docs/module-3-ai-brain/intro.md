# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module covers NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic synthetic data, perception systems, navigation, and Nav2 for humanoid robot path planning.

## Overview

The AI-Robot Brain module focuses on implementing intelligent systems for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac tools and ROS 2. This includes perception, navigation, and cognitive planning capabilities.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you will learn about:

- **Isaac Sim**: Photorealistic synthetic data generation and high-fidelity simulation for robotics
- **Perception Systems**: Implementing perception using ROS 2 and Isaac tools
- **Navigation & Path Planning**: Using Nav2 for humanoid robot path planning with kinematic constraints

## Chapters

- [Chapter 1: Isaac Sim Basics](./chapter-1-isaac-sim-basics.md)
- [Chapter 2: Perception and Navigation](./chapter-2-perception-navigation.md)
- [Chapter 3: Nav2 Path Planning](./chapter-3-nav2-path-planning.md)

The AI-Robot Brain is essential for creating autonomous humanoid robots that can understand their environment and navigate complex spaces safely.
